## Course 5: Analyze Data to Answer Questions

Current Progress: Completed up to Module 2 (Format and Adjust Data)

üìå Module 1 ‚Äì Organize Data for More Effective Analysis
In this module, I built a strong foundation in the data analysis process and the importance of keeping data organized.

I learned how sorting and filtering are essential techniques that allow analysts to quickly find, arrange, and focus on the most relevant data. Whether in spreadsheets or SQL, I practiced different methods of sorting data (alphabetical, numerical, ascending, and descending) and filtering datasets to isolate only the information that matters for analysis.

I also worked with CSV files and BigQuery, gaining exposure to handling large-scale datasets. Through hands-on activities, I applied SQL sorting queries and analyzed weather data in BigQuery. These exercises helped me understand how different tools (Excel, Google Sheets, SQL) achieve similar goals but with unique advantages depending on dataset size and complexity.

I wrapped up this module with a challenge exercise that tested my ability to apply sorting and filtering techniques in real scenarios. I also completed all quizzes ‚Äî including graded ones ‚Äî with a perfect 100% score, confirming my grasp of these essential concepts.

üìå Module 2 ‚Äì Format and Adjust Data
This module focused on making data consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis by applying formatting techniques and transformations.

I started with data formatting in spreadsheets, including converting data from one type to another (text to numbers, proper date formats). A step-by-step lesson on type conversion gave me the foundation to clean and adjust messy datasets.

I then explored data validation to control what values can be entered into cells, improving accuracy. I applied conditional formatting to highlight patterns, outliers, and errors ‚Äî making data visually clear and easy to interpret.

I also learned how to transform and format data with SQL, which deepened my understanding of back-end database management. The module expanded into importing and combining data from spreadsheets and databases. Using both step-by-step guidance and hands-on activities, I practiced merging text strings, manipulating strings with SQL, and combining multiple datasets to build unified, analyzable data tables.

Additionally, I explored advanced spreadsheet tips and tricks to increase efficiency. A reflective lesson, ‚ÄúWhen to Use Which Tool‚Äù, helped me understand how to choose between spreadsheets, SQL, or other platforms depending on the scope of analysis.

Finally, I completed practical activities like string manipulation, merging datasets, and importing data, alongside self-reflection exercises and glossary reviews. Like Module 1, I scored 100% on all quizzes, including graded assessments.

üìå Reflection and Takeaways
Completing these two modules has given me a strong foundation in organizing, formatting, and adjusting data ‚Äî the essential first steps before deeper analysis.

From sorting and filtering, I learned how to structure data for clarity.

From formatting and validation, I gained skills to ensure accuracy and consistency.

From string manipulation and combining datasets, I learned how to unify multiple sources for deeper insights.

Hands-on work in SQL and BigQuery exposed me to real-world analytics tools.

Key takeaway: Clean, organized, and well-formatted data is the foundation for reliable insights. Without this preparation, analysis can easily become misleading or incomplete.

With these modules completed, I am ready to move into more advanced modules in Course 5, confident in my ability to prepare data effectively for meaningful analysis.
